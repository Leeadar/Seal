This is a hackathon project made during the MTA Hack 2021.

### **Who are we?**
In the past, workplaces were proud of rich dining rooms. Then the corona came, we started working from home, and we had to become our own private chef.

A well-thought-out meal plan can help you improve your diet quality or reach a specific health goal while saving you time and money along the way.

### Why using us?
Our idea is to provide the customer with various recipes and possible preparation times. You can choose from three kitchen styles and in seconds, finding a rich and healthy lunch.
